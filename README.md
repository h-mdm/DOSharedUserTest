# DOSharedUserTest - using shared user to grant privileged functions to the application

This app must be signed with the same keys as the Device Owner app and use the same shared user ID.

It demonstrates rebooting the device (this option is only available to the Device Owner).

To use the sample with Headwind MDM, please build the launcher release (https://github.com/h-mdm/hmdm-android) and sign your application with the same keys as Headwind MDM launcher.
